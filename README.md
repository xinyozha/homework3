The goal of this R package is set a Linear regression function (my_lm)
to find some basic information such as point estimate, fitted.values,
residuals, mse, rsquared, adj_rsquared, standard error of beta,
t.statistic, p.value, F.statistic, df1 and df2. Additionally, set a
function (my_confint) to get the CI.
